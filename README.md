## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1️⃣ Prerequisites

- **Node.js 18+** installed
- **npm** or **pnpm**
- **Firebase CLI** installed globally
- A Firebase project created at [console.firebase.google.com](https://console.firebase.google.com)

### 2️⃣ Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/DDSH-website.git
cd DDSH-website
```

### 3️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
pnpm install
```

### 4️⃣ Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

### 5️⃣ Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

This generates a static export in the `out/` directory (required for Firebase Hosting).

### 6️⃣ Deploy to Firebase

```bash
# Login to Firebase (first time only)
firebase login

# Initialize Firebase (first time only)
firebase init hosting
# → Select your project
# → Set public directory to: out
# → Configure as single-page app: No (static export)

# Deploy
firebase deploy --only hosting
```

**Expected output:**
```
✔ Deploy complete!
Hosting URL: https://YOUR-PROJECT.web.app
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration

Customize all site content in `lib/constants.ts`. This is the single source of truth for copy, stats, and feature data.

Key configuration:

```typescript
// Site metadata
export const SITE_CONFIG = {
  name: "DDSH",
  tagline: "The AI Layer That Keeps Drivers Alive.",
  author: "Vivek Ranjan Sahoo",
  institution: "ITER, SOA University",
  githubUrl: "https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/DDSH",
  linkedinUrl: "https://linkedin.com/in/YOUR_PROFILE",
}

// Hero stats (animated counters)
export const HERO_STATS = [
  { value: 90, suffix: "%", label: "Detection Accuracy" },
  { value: 2, suffix: "s", label: "Alert Response Time" },
  { value: 30, suffix: "FPS", label: "Real-Time Processing" },
  { value: 133, suffix: "", label: "Body Keypoints Tracked" },
]

// Feature cards (Use Cases section)
export const FEATURES = [ ... ]
```

## 🎬 Demo Preparation

### For Live Showcase Presentation:

1. **Test on target machine before the event:**
   ```bash
   npm run build && npx serve out
   ```

2. **Verify all animations load correctly** — check scroll-triggered reveals on a fresh browser tab (no cached state)

3. **Test terminal demo section** — ensure typewriter animation loops cleanly

4. **Prepare offline fallback:**
   ```bash
   # Host locally if internet is unavailable at venue
   npm run build
   npx serve out -p 3000
   # Open: http://localhost:3000
   ```

5. **What to show judges:**
   - Scroll through the full landing page (1–2 min)
   - Highlight the DrowsAI™ + PoseGuard™ dual-layer cards
   - Point to Roadmap features (amber badges) — shows product vision
   - Show the terminal demo — live detection output simulation
   - Reference the peer-reviewed paper citation cards for credibility

### Handling Demo Failures:

| Issue | Solution |
|---|---|
| No internet at venue | Use `npx serve out` for local hosting |
| Animations laggy | Open in Chrome, disable browser extensions |
| Fonts not loading | Fonts are loaded from Google CDN — pre-cache or embed locally |
| Firebase URL down | Use the locally hosted build as backup |

---

## 📊 Platform Overview (for Judges)

DDSH is positioned as a **two-layer driver safety intelligence platform**:

```
Layer 1 — DrowsAI™ (Eye Intelligence)
    MobileNet Transfer Learning
    → 90% accuracy | 100% precision
    → Alarm at 6 consecutive closed-eye frames (~2 sec)

Layer 2 — PoseGuard™ (Body Intelligence)
    MediaPipe Holistic / HRNet Whole-body
    → 133 keypoints (body + face + hands + feet)
    → Posture slump + head drop detection

Combined Signal → Higher confidence alerts, fewer false positives
```

## 📖 Research Foundation

This website documents an implementation grounded in two peer-reviewed publications:

**Paper 1 — DDSH Core System:**
```
Bhanja, S., et al. (2025). Driver Drowsiness Shield (DDSH): A Real-Time 
Driver Drowsiness Detection System. ROBOMECH Journal.
DOI: 10.1186/s40648-025-00307-4
```

**Paper 2 — Pose Estimation Module:**
```
Wei, F., Xu, G., et al. (2025). Whole-body 2D human pose estimation based 
on human keypoints distribution constraint and adaptive Gaussian factor. 
Complex & Intelligent Systems, 11:415.
DOI: 10.1007/s40747-025-02054-w
```

## ⚠️ Known Limitations

1. **Static Export Only**: Firebase Hosting requires `output: 'export'` — no server-side rendering or API routes
2. **No Backend**: This is a showcase website only — it does not connect to the live ML model
3. **Video Placeholder**: The demo section uses a simulated terminal, not actual live webcam feed
4. **Mobile Animations**: Some complex Framer Motion animations may be reduced on low-powered mobile devices

## 🔮 Roadmap Features (Showcased on Website)

These are innovation ideas presented on the website as **future roadmap items** (amber badge):

1. **Child Safety Mode** — Detects irregular rear-seat child movements, activates child locks
2. **Insurance Telematics** — DrowsinessScore™ per trip for usage-based premium calculation
3. **Fatigue Analytics Dashboard** — Post-trip heatmaps and route-level safety scoring
4. **Emergency Auto-Response** — Autonomous hazard lights + emergency service contact
5. **Micro-sleep Prediction** — Pre-drowsy pattern detection before full eye closure
6. **Weather-Correlated Fatigue** — Alert sensitivity adjusted for night/rain conditions
7. **Voice + Posture Biometrics** — Fused speech slurring + pose slump for DUI detection assist
